Speedup and Efficiency
======================

           Sequential
Speedup = ———————————
            Parallel

Ex: if the serial application executes in 6720 seconds and a corresponding
parallel application runs in 126.7 seconds (using 64 threads and cores), the
speedup of the parallel application is 53X (6720/126.7 = 53.038).

                       Speedup
Efficiency = ———————————————————————————
              Number of Cores (threads)


Amdahl's Law
============

                          1
Speedup <= ————————————————————————
                            pctPar
            (1 - pctPar) + ———————
                               p


*) pctPar: parallel execution time 
*) 1 - pctPar : serial execution time
*) p : number of threads/cores

The parallel execution time is estimated to be the percentage of serial
execution (1 - pctPar) and the percentage of execution that can be run in
parallel divided by the number of cores to be used (pctPar/p). 


Ex: if 95% of a serial application's run time could be executed in parallel on
eight cores, the estimated speedup, according to Amdahl's Law, could as much
6X (1 / (0.05 + 0.95/8) = 5.925).


Gustafson's Law
===============

Speedup <= p + (1 - p)*s

*) p : number of cores
*) s : percentage of serial execution time in the parallel application for a
given data set size

Ex: if 1% of execution time on 32 cores will be spent in serial execution, the
speedup of this application over the same data set being run on a single core
with a single thread (assuming that to be possible) is:

Speedup <= 32 + (1 - 32)(0.01) = 32 - 0,31 = 31,69X

Consider what Amdahl's Law would estimate for the speedup with these
assumptions. Assuming the serial execution percentage to be 1%, the equation
for Amdahl's Law yields 1/(0.01 + (0.99/32)) = 24.43X. This is a false
computation, however, since the given percentage of serial time is relative to
the 32-core execution.

On the other hand, if the total parallel application execution time is known in
the 32-core case, the fully serial execution time can be calculated and the
speed up for that fix-sized problem (further assuming that it could be computed
with a single core) could be predicted with Amdahl's Law on 32 cores. Assuming
the total execution time for a parallel application is 1040 seconds on 32 cores,
then 1% of that time would be serial only, or 10.4 seconds. By multiplying the
number of seconds (1029.6) for parallel execution on 32 cores, the total amount
of work done by the application takes 1029.6*32+10.4 = 32957.6 seconds. The
nonparallel time (10.4 seconds) is 0.032% of that total work time. Using that
figure, Amdahl's Law calculates a speedup of 1/(0.00032 + (0.99968/32)) = 31.686X.
